/======================== Working with the Weather API ===========================/
- The best weather API is OpenWeatherAPI
    -- Create a account
    -- Choose the Current Weather API 

- Save the API Key in another JS file.

- Create a get weather function in the JS logic file. That function will fetch the details from the API
and display them.

    fn => let getWeather = () => {

    }

- Create a function that as soon as the page finish loading, it will the 
getWeather() function.

    fn => window.addEventListener("load", getWeather);

- Inside the getWeather function, create a varuabe called url and assign the url link that the OpenWeatherAPI
gives you and insert the code.

- It depends on how many data you're going to show. 
If you're showing city:
    city => let city = city.value;

- Have to check if input field is empty if you're adding a search function.
If it is empty, alert the user to input a city.
If it's not, feth the data from the API. 

- The fetch(url) function is used to search for data on the API.

    function => fetch(url).then((resp) => resp.json())
                    .then(data => {
                        console.log(data);
                    })
                    .catch(() => {
                        // Not found
                    });

- The resp is the response the API call will get and it will turn it
into a JSON format. 

- Then the data logs/displays everything. You have to specify the data that you want. Documentation of the API. 
As an example, if you want the weather name:

    example: then(data => {
        console.log(data.weather);
    })
If you want the icon for the weather.

    exmaple: then(data => {
        console.log(data.weather[0].icon);
    })
